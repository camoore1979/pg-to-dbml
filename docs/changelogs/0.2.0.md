# CHANGELOG

## 0.2.0

### Changes

- Refactored to abstract logic to separate function modules, use await-async rather than callbacks.
- DIS-814
  - refactored main.js for clearer, more explicit options
  - added options -s for schemas to include, -S for schemas to skip, -T for tables to skip
  - added dbml output of primary key and relations between tables
  - added option --separate_dbml_by_schema to determine whether to separate dbml output file(s) by schema name,
