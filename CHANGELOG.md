# CHANGELOG

## x.x.x

### Features

- DEVOPS-715:
  - Auto-publish a beta package whenever Code Checks completes successfully.
  - Switch Actions to use a reusable workflow from the new polarislabs/actions repo.
  - Remove the First Time Greeting and PR Labeler Actions, since we're wanting to reduce our Github Actions minutes where it's easy.
